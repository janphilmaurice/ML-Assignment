From Assessment file: **You must submit the code that you use for the preprocessing** and describe how to rerun this on the original dataset as part of your code submission

# Data Preprocessing:

The original file is Master_Data.csv, and the preprocessing focuses on three main tasks: 1) converting string-type variables into numbers, 2) filling in incomplete data, and 3) eliminating data errors.

The original file has 27 columns and 50,000 rows and it consist of credit information data spread in a 4 month period. Each person has a unique identifier (Costumer_ID) and personal information of the person is displayed along with the credits taken, interest rates, payments, prepayments, etc.

## Converting string-type variables into numbers

[to complete] The functions used for that and the expplanation are the following:

## Filling in incomplete data

[to complete] The functions used for that and the expplanation are the following:

## Eliminating data errors.

[to complete] This dataset in particular had several typos in the data, in particular, age..

# Derived Datasets:

Pending to complete. Important because we need to decide how are we going to construct the derived datasets and explain the approach (in the report)
